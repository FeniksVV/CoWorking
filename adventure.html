                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo
                    for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles. Breath of the Wild is part of the Legend of Zelda franchise and
                    is set at the end of the Zelda timeline; the player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber
                    to defeat Calamity Ganon and save the kingdom of Hyrule.
                    Similar to the original The Legend of Zelda (1986) game, players are given little instruction and can
                    explore the open world freely. Tasks include collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or solving
                    puzzles and side quests for rewards. The world is unstructured and designed to reward experimentation, and
                the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion. </p>
