                <p>The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by ZeniMax
                    Online Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in
                    April 2014, with versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S planned. It is a part of the Elder
                    Scrolls series. The game is set in the continent of Tamriel and features a storyline indirectly connected
                    with the other games in the Elder Scrolls franchise. It had been in development for seven years before its
                    release in 2014. It initially received mixed reviews, but these improved significantly with the re-release
                    and rebranding as The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, with critics praising the changes that were
                made.</p>

                    <p>Crossout is a free-to-play vehicular combat video game developed by Targem Games and is published by Gaijin
                        Entertainment for Android, Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game depicts a post-apocalyptic setting
                        after a nuclear war and "human genetic testing gone awry", showing some resemblance to the Mad Max
                        universe. Events of Crossout take place in the same universe as Ex Machinaâ€™s (aka Hard Truck: Apocalypse
                        in the North American market), which is also a Targem-created game published by Buka in 2005. Crossout aims
                    to depict life on Earth 20 years after the 2027 global disaster, and 200 years before Ex Machina.</p>
