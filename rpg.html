                <p>Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic action role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment
                    and published by Bethesda Softworks. A spin-off of the Fallout series, the game is set in a post-apocalyptic
                    open world environment that encompasses a region consisting of Arizona, California, and Nevada. It is set in
                    a world that deviated onto an alternate timeline thanks to Atomic Age technology, which eventually led to a
                    global nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 in an event referred to as "The Great War", caused by a major
                conflict between the U.S. and China over natural resources.</p>
