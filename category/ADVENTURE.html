        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo
            for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles. Breath of the Wild is part of the Legend of Zelda franchise and
            is set at the end of the Zelda timeline; the player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber
            to defeat Calamity Ganon and save the kingdom of Hyrule.
            Similar to the original The Legend of Zelda (1986) game, players are given little instruction and can
            explore the open world freely. Tasks include collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or solving
            puzzles and side quests for rewards. The world is unstructured and designed to reward experimentation, and
            the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion. </p>
