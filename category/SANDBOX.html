        <p>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may
            discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on
            game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other
            players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to
            build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players
            can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.</p>
