        <p>Mortal Kombat is an American media franchise centered on a series of video games, originally developed by
            Midway Games in 1992. The development of the first game was originally based on an idea that Ed Boon and
            John Tobias had of making a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, but as that idea fell through, a
            fantasy-themed fighting game was created instead, nonetheless paying homage to him with nut-cracking movie
            star character Johnny Cage, whose initials and personal style echo Van Damme's. Mortal Kombat was the first
            ever fighting game to introduce a secret fighter, reached if the player fulfilled a set of requirements.</p>

        <p>Dungeons 3 is a video game developed by Realmforge Studios and published by Kalypso Media. It was released on
            October 13, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the sequel to the
            2015 video game Dungeons 2 and the third installment of the Dungeons series. Dungeons 3 combines dungeon
            building with real-time strategy elements. Players are tasked with creating an underground dungeon for
            creatures to live in as well as defending their dungeon against invading heroes from the world above. They
            can also send creatures to the world above where they can take direct control of their units. The game's
            single-player campaign follows the story of Thalya, a dark elf sorcerer, on her quest to conquer the
            continent she lives on at the behest of the Dungeon Lord from the previous games. In multiplayer, players
            can either cooperate to play the campaign or compete against each other.</p>
