                                original Modern Warfare saga, a direct sequel to 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and the eighth Call

                                campaign, changing perspectives throughout the progression of the story, which, like its predecessors, is
                                divided into three sets of missions called "Acts". Each mission in an act featuring a series of objectives
                                that are displayed on the heads up display, which marks the direction and distance between such objectives
                            and the player.</p>
